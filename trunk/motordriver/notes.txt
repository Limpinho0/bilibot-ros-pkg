notes:

make sure the interrupt function is correct, or the chip will reset when the interrupt is enabled
-(this did not show up until the interrupt was called though)

must read/clear the recieve buffer in order to continue transmitting when using recieve interrupt.
also, remember that the programmer shares the rx,tx ports, so you have to unplug the programmer to transmit data
